# dog-breed-classifier
A machine learning algorithm based on Convolutional Neural Networks to identify dog breeds.

Goal of the project: to learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
